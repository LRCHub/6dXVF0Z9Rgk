[00:10.90] Standing on the edge of my intention
[00:13.79] Looking down into my hell
[00:16.27] And all I see are people in destruction
[00:18.86] Begging for an answer
[00:29.36] 
[00:21.80] But above the hate they carry on in silence
[00:24.33] They believe the only voice inside
[00:27.14] And it's not another nightmare
[00:28.76] Of how you'll surrender your life today
[00:48.26] 
[00:33.29] I hear their voices now
[00:36.08] A pain awake again
[00:39.21] Feel their eyes as you run
[00:41.10] But you cannot hide
[00:42.57] So you gotta release your soul tonight, yeah
[01:04.57] 
[00:47.34] This is my hell
[00:48.89] I live to tell
[00:50.29] The only story of how I betrayed my own direction
[00:53.93] There's nowhere to go
[00:55.20] In time you'll know
[00:56.56] You gotta live to die
[01:07.06] 
[00:58.30] This is my hell
[00:59.57] And time will tell
[01:00.10] The only story of how I forgave my own deception
[01:04.45] There's nowhere to go
[01:05.80] In time you'll know
[01:07.01] Today you've gotta die to keep yourself alive
[01:29.51] 
[01:12.50] You live, you die, and life goes on
[01:30.00] 
[01:20.51] Staring at the sight of my reflection
[01:23.13] Broken by these silent screams
[01:25.70] But all I feel are shards of imperfection
[01:28.24] Piercing through my dreams
[01:41.24] 
[01:31.05] But another night I've wasted in defiance
[01:33.81] I believe the only voice inside
[01:36.33] And it's just another nightmare
[01:38.12] Of how I'll surrender my life today
[01:55.62] 
[01:42.66] I feel their presence now
[01:45.33] A fear that takes me in
[01:48.96] All the sins, all the lies
[01:50.41] That I can't deny
[01:52.09] So you gotta release your soul tonight, yeah
[02:14.09] 
[01:56.66] This is my hell
[01:58.19] I live to tell
[01:59.59] The only story of how I betrayed my own direction
[02:03.16] There's nowhere to go
[02:04.55] In time you'll know
[02:05.84] You gotta live to die
[02:16.34] 
[02:07.55] This is my hell
[02:08.74] And time will tell
[02:10.18] The only story of how I forgave my own deception
[02:13.84] There's nowhere to go
[02:15.12] In time you'll know
[02:16.58] Today you've gotta die to keep yourself alive
[02:39.08] 
[02:40.22] You bleed, you bleed, you bleed
[02:41.92] Your heart is bleeding
[02:43.35] You're on your knees you're praying now
[02:45.46] For all the sins and the tragedies you've buried deep
[02:50.78] You breathe, you breathe, you breathe
[02:52.69] Your soul is breathing
[02:54.09] And now you feel the burn inside
[02:56.12] So take your life and make it right
[03:13.62] 
[03:02.43] This is my hell
[03:03.69] I live to tell
[03:04.99] The only story of how I betrayed my own direction
[03:08.70] There's nowhere to go
[03:09.91] In time you'll know
[03:11.26] You gotta live to die
[03:21.76] 
[03:12.94] This is my hell
[03:14.27] And time will tell
[03:15.53] The only story of how I forgave my own deception
[03:19.26] There's nowhere to go
[03:20.66] In time you'll know
[03:21.89] Today you've gotta die to keep yourself alive
[03:44.39] 
[03:27.38] You live, you die, and life goes on
[03:38.07] You live, you die, and life goes on
[03:55.57] 
[03:45.78] This is the life you chose
[03:48.16] And you know the story must go on
