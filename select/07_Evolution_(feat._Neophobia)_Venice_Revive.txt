Across the center of the earth
We'll never be replaced
(Be replaced)
From the depths of the ocean, they rose
Bottom feeders turned into the rulers of all
Enter the giants
This evolution vacates creation
Like a revolution
Who will survive this primal age?
Lost within time and space
To the tops of the mountains, we'll go
Searching for an answer
In the sky or underneath the snow
Strike of the hunter
In rapid fire
Lightning and thunder
We mustn't cede
Enter the giants
This evolution vacates creation
Like a revolution
Who will survive this primal age?
Lost within time and space
Across the center of the earth
We'll never be replaced
Reign
Until nothing will remain
Fear thy mass extinction
You can't stop this rampage
You can't stop this
You can't stop this rampage
Who will survive this primal age?
Lost within time and space
Across the center of the earth
We'll never be replaced
Hold on to your tales
Hold on to your tales
'Till death or 'till we all prevail
'Till death or 'till we all prevail
'Till death or 'till we all prevail
'Till death or 'till we all prevail
