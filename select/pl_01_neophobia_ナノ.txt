Standing on the edge of my
intention
looking down into my hell
and all I see are people in
destruction
begging for an answer
But above the hate they carry on
in silence
they believe the only voice
inside
and it's not another nightmare
of how you'll surrender
your life today
I hear their voices now
a pain awake again
Feel their eyes as you run
but you cannot hide
so you gotta release your soul
tonight, yeah
This is my hell
I live to tell
the only story of how I betrayed
my own direction
There's nowhere to go
in time you'll know
you gotta live to die
This is my hell
and time will tell
the only story of how I forgave
my own deception
There's nowhere to go
in time you'll know
today you've gotta die to keep
yourself alive
You live, you die, and life goes
on
Staring at the sight of my
reflection
broken by these silent screams
and all I feel are shards of
imperfection
piercing through my dreams
But another night I've wasted in
defiance
I believe the only voice inside
and it's just another nightmare
of how I'll surrender
my life today
I feel their presence now
a fear that takes me in
All the sins, all the lies
that you can't deny
so you gotta release your soul
tonight, yeah
This is my hell
I live to tell
the only story of how I betrayed
my own direction
There's nowhere to go
in time you'll know
you gotta live to die
This is my hell
and time will tell
the only story of how I forgave
my own deception
There's nowhere to go
in time you'll know
today you've gotta die to keep
yourself alive
You bleed, you bleed, you bleed,
your heart is bleeding
you're on your knees you're
praying now
for all the sins and the
tragedies you've buried deep
You breathe, you breathe, you
breathe,
your soul is breathing
and now you feel the burn inside
so take your life and make it
right
This is my hell
I live to tell
the only story of how I betrayed
my own direction
There's nowhere to go
in time you'll know
you gotta live to die
This is my hell
and time will tell
the only story of how I forgave
my own deception
There's nowhere to go
in time you'll know
today you've gotta die to keep
yourself alive
You live, you die, and life goes
on
You live, you die, and life goes
on
This is the life you chose
and you know the story must go
on
